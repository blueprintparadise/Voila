Voila is a groundbreaking family of large audio-language foundation models that revolutionizes human-AI interactions. Breaking away from the constraints of traditional voice AI systems‚Äîhigh latency, loss of vocal nuances, and mechanical responses, Voila employs an innovative end-to-end model design and a novel hierarchical Transformer architecture. This approach enables real-time, autonomous, and rich voice interactions, with latency as low as 195 ms, surpassing average human response times. Combining advanced voice and language modeling, Voila offers customizable, persona-driven engagements and excels in a range of audio tasks from ASR and TTS to speech translation across six languages. With the online [web demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/maitrix-org/Voila-demo), Voila invites you to explore a transformative, natural dialogue experience between human and AI.

# ‚ú® Highlights
- ‚≠ê High-fidelity, low-latency, real-time streaming audio processing
- ‚≠ê Effective integration of voice and language modeling capabilities
- ‚≠ê Millions of pre-built and custom voices, fast voice switching during conversation
- ‚≠ê Unified model for various audio tasks

# üìÅ Datasets
We publish the following two datasets: Voila Benchmark and Voila Voice Library. Voila-Benchmark is a novel speech evaluation benchmark, while Voila Voice Library provides millions of pre-built and customizable voices.

| Dataset | Description | Download Link |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
|Voila Benchmark| Evaluation of Voila Benchmark | https://huggingface.co/datasets/maitrix-org/Voila-Benchmark |
|Voila Voice Library| Millons of pre-build voices | https://huggingface.co/datasets/maitrix-org/Voila-million-voice

# üìä Benchmark
## 1. Voila Benchmark
We introduce a novel speech evaluation benchmark called the VoilaBenchmark. The Voila Benchmark is constructed by sampling from five widely used language model evaluation datasets: MMLU, MATH, OpenAI HumanEval, NQ-Open, and GSM8k. We compare our results with SpeechGPT and Moshi.
| Model | Voila Benchmark |
|-------|----------------|
|SpeechGPT| 13.29|
|Moshi | 11.45 |
|**Voila** | **30.56** |

_(higher is better)_

For detailed scores of Voila Benchmark on each specific domain, please refer to our paper (Section 5.1 "Evaluation of Voila Benchmark").
## 2. Evaluation of ASR
As Voila supports multiple tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech(TTS), and spoken question answering, we also evaluate the performance of ASR and TTS. 
For ASR, we assess performance on the LibriSpeech test-clean dataset, using Word Error Rate (WER) as our metric. Voila attains a word error rate (WER) of 4.8%, outperforming the 5.7% reported by Moshi. In scenarios where both models utilize LibriSpeech training data, Voila achieves an impressive WER of 2.7%.
| Model | LibriSpeech test-clean (WER) |
|-------|-----------------------|
|Whisper large v2|2.7|
|Whisper large v3|2.2|
|FastConformer|3.6|
|VoxtLM |2.7|
|Moshi |5.7|
|**Voila (w/o LibriSpeech train split)** |**4.8**|
|**Voila (with LibriSpeech train split)**|**2.7**|

_(lower is better)_

## 3. Evaluation of TTS
For TTS, we follow the evaluation metrics proposed in Vall-E, which involves transcribing the generated audio using HuBERT-Large.
Voila once again leads with a WER of 3.2% (and 2.8% when using LibriSpeech training data).

| Model | LibriSpeech test-clean (WER) |
|-------|-----------------------|
|YourTTS |7.7|
|Vall-E|5.9|
|Moshi|4.7|
|**Voila (w/o LibriSpeech train split)** |**3.2**|
|**Voila (with LibriSpeech train split)** |**2.8**|

_(lower is better)_
